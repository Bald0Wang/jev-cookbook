"""Camera-corrected parser: fixes the nametable page selection for the live emulator.

The bug
-------
Upstream ``MarioStateParser._extract_local_grid`` samples the 2 KB RAM tile buffer at
0x0500 using the *absolute* level x::

    page  = (sample_x // 256) % 2
    sub_x = (sample_x % 256) // 16

That is correct only if the two 16x13 nametable pages are aligned to even 256px
boundaries of the level.  On the real emulator they are not: the game scrolls the pair of
pages along with the camera, so the buffer covers the level window

    [256 * floor(camera / 256), 256 * floor(camera / 256) + 512)

Whenever ``floor(camera / 256)`` is **odd**, the upstream page choice is off by exactly
one page (256px).  Measured consequence (see REPORT §11): with Mario at x=1094 the
upstream grid is *completely empty* — no pit, no ground, no pipe — while the
camera-derived grid shows the terrain.  Half the time the model's only hazard sensor is
blind, which is why episodes kept dying at the same pits: the model was told the path
was clear.

The fix here
------------
``CorrectedParser`` subclasses the upstream parser and, after the normal parse, rebuilds
the 11x9 grid from the same RAM with the camera-derived base and patches it into the
frozen snapshot.  Every derived fact the model sees (``terrain.obstacle_ahead``,
``gap_distance_tiles``, the local grid itself) is recomputed from the corrected grid,
because the upstream snapshot derives them from ``local_grid`` lazily.  Nothing upstream
is modified; the wrapper is injected wherever our scripts construct the runner.
